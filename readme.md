## 📝 Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to develop a full-stack Task Tracker application that allows users to manage and monitor the progress of their projects and associated tasks. The application should support multiple users, with each user allowed to create and manage up to four projects. Within each project, users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks. Each task must include a title, description, status to track progress (such as Pending, In Progress, or Completed), and timestamps for both creation and completion. User accounts should include essential details like name, email, password, and country, with secure authentication implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The application must ensure proper data encapsulation, follow best coding practices, and maintain high code quality. The backend will be developed using ExpressJS, while the frontend will be built with ReactJS. Data storage will be handled using either MongoDB or PostgreSQL. The final application should be fully functional, deployable, and well-documented, including setup instructions and relevant links in a README file. Additional functionalities and self-hosting are encouraged for bonus points.
